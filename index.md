#### Hi. I'm Adam.

I'm a philosophy student and teacher. Right now I'm a graduate student in the [philosophy department][0] at the [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign][1], and an adjunct instructor at both [Heartland Community College][4] and [Lincoln College][5].

My research is motivated by an interest in projects in philosophy of science and metaphysics that involve causal graphical models. These projects include defending a view of scientific explanation where causal models play a significant role, developing an empiricist-minded modal epistemology, and giving a causal modeling analysis of dynamic systems. 

My dissertation is on causal modeling interventions and experimental design. 

I also have research interests in the potential of data mining and machine learning [to contribute to philosophical inquiry][2] and in [experimental philosophy][3].
