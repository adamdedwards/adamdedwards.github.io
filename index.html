<h3>Hi. I'm Adam.</h3>

<p>I'm a philosophy student and teacher. Right now I'm a graduate student in the philosophy department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign,
  and an adjunct instructor at both Heartland Community College and Lincoln College.</p>

<p>My research is motivated by an interest in projects in philosophy of science and metaphysics that involve causal graphical models.
  These projects include defending a view of scientific explanation where causal models play a significant role,
  developing an empiricist-minded modal epistemology, and giving a causal modeling analysis of dynamic systems.</p>

<p>My dissertation is on causal modeling interventions and experimental design.</p>
