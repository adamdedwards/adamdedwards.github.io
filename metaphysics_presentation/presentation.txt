# Outline

##
Maudlin's chapter proceeds in four stages:

1. First, he describes what he takes to be the methodological commitments of any metaphysician.
2. Next, he explains why metaphysics has, up until now, mistaken linguistic structure with ontological structure.
3. Third, he argues that we should abandon universals since metaphysically pure relations do not exist.
4. Finally, he lays out an alternative ontological structure based contemporary __gauge theories__.

# Methods 

## 
###Foundational Thesis:

Metaphysics is __ontology__.

##

1. Ontology is the most generic account of what exists.
2. Our only access to what exists is empirical evidence.
3. Ontology can only proceed by appeal to empirical evidence.

## 
###Programmatic Thesis:

Given that we _can_ escape our conceptual system (that is, given that Kant was wrong) we should be suspicious that our current conceptual system gets it right.

<!--
- Foundationally, the claim is that metaphysics just is ontology and that empirical science must be our guide to understanding that ontology. 
- Programmatically, given the influence our representational system has over the kinds of things we come to know, we should be suspicious of ontological systems which show how our representational system is a guide to the world. That is, we should raise our hackles at any attempt to we infer from representation to represented, instead of the other way round.
-->

> "Reflection on philosophical problems has convinced me that a much larger number than I used to think... are connected with the principles of symbolism[.] The result of this is that almost all thinking that purports to be philosophical or logical consists in attributing to the world properties of language." (Russell 1923)

# Metaphysical Purity

##

A property/relation is __metaphysically pure__ iff that property/relation does not obtain in virtue of some further property/relation obtaining, such as the existence of some other thing. 

This is why siblinghood is supposed to be intuitively impure (because siblinghood obtains in virtue of something else, namely parents, existing).

# Parallelisms Between Language and Reality

## 
###Aristotle

Substance <--> Universal   
Subject <--> Predicate

##
###Quine

> "to be is to be the value of a variable"

<!--
Maudlin compares the metaphysical project of understanding universals since Aristotle and through Quine as one long mistaken attempt to arrive at an ontology through the features of syntax and grammar.
-->

##
###Quine's Recipe

1. Settle on some sentences that you take to be true.
2. Translate these sentences into a formalized language, such as first- or second-order predicate calculus.
3. Determine what must be in the domain of quantification of the variables of the translated sentences in order that they come out true.

# External Relations

## What is an external relation?

##

An __external relation__ is a relation which is in some sense external to its bearer in that the relation could fail to hold and its subject would still be the same.

Ex: siblinghood, studenthood, adjacency, distance

##

External relations are not metaphysically pure since any external relation requires that something else, in additional to the relata, exist.

Ex: Minkowski Distance

# Internal Relations 

##
### What is an internal relation?

An __internal relation__ is a relation which is internal to its bearer in the sense that the bearer of the relation would not be the thing that it is if that relation failed to hold.

Ex: Numbers, vectors, masses, charges, spins

# Gauge Theories

## 

Classical electrodynamics and modern quantum mechanics are __gauge theories__, meaning that they obey certain symmetries. Another way of thinking about these symmetries is that they are __invariances with respect to certain classes of transformations.__

##Transformations

Imagine we take an experiment and move it 5 meters towards the Hague. What should we expect? Why?

##Electrodynamics

> + Example of a gauge invariance: magnetic potential

> + A &rarr; A - &nabla;&Lambda; 

##Chromodynamics

> + Example of a gauge invariance: quark color

##
###Why are symmetries important?

Lots of physical theories exhibit invariances like this. What is important for Maudlin is that the symmetry obtains _because of the curvature of the space_.

##

##

Gauge theories, for Maudlin, attach trope-like entities at particular spacetime points that _could not be instantiated elsewhere on the manifold_.

The similarity relation, then, is not intrinsic because its obtaining depends critically on the path (which, in turn, is affected by the curvature of the manifold). 

# How useful are these suggestions?

##
###Some Questions:

 * Is Maudlin relying on Quine's Recipe, but simply replacing one formal language with another?
 * Why not think that gauge invariances are good examples of a pure internal relations?
 * Is Maudlin correct about distance being metaphysically impure? What about Minkowski distance?
 * Is Maudlin's ontological account based on gauge theories a trope theory?
